## Week 2 - Useful tips for using R and RMarkdown

To find help on a function use the ? followed by the function for example: `?mean `

Using `str()` gives a summary of the objects structure.

Use `toupper()` to convert a string to uppercase

Use `tolower()` to convert a string to lowercase

To select elements from a vector use []

For example:

`x[4]` The fourth element.

`x[-4]` All but the fourth.

`x[2:4]` Elements two to four.

`x[-(2:4)]` All elements except two to four.

`x[c(1, 5)]` Elements one and five.
