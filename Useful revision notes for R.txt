Lecture 3:

Data structures in R;

- Matrices
can be numeric or character but not both.

matrix()

##return the value of the matrix in the first row and the second column
our_matrix[1, 2]

Remember - for square brackets the order is always [row, column] when 
you are accessing a 2-dimensional object.

- Data frames
create data frames using the data.frame() function as follows:

#make a data frame with information on whether a Species was seen (1 = yes, 0 = no), on a particular Day:
our_data <- data.frame("Day" = rep(1:3, each = 3), 
                       "Species" = rep(letters[1:3], each = 3),
                       "Seen" = rbinom(n = 9, size = 1, prob = 0.5))

You can use the $ operator to add a column to a data.frame. 
We use it to specify then name of the column and 
give some data to fill that column with:

##add a new column called location
our_data$location <- "United Kingdom"
You will see if you now look at our_data that we have added this new column,
and that this is filled with the value “United Kingdom”. 
If we just provied a single value (“United Kingdom”) 
R will assume we want this repeated in ever row of the column automatically.
